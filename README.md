# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

I'm Law, my pronouns are he/him, and I like playing mainly action games where you fight against multiplayer enemies. I play games like league, overwatch, teamfight tactics, and valorant. I'm taking this class to learn more about game development and to see if it something I want to pursue. I've created a game using gamemaker studio 2 from scratch before for a competition before and it was just a kind of bad platformer thing. I hope to learn how to build shooter games or something similar to fps.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [X] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I'm hoping to see if coding for games is something that I want to pursue in the future and how good I would be at doing it.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I'm nervous at making things look good since I've never been good at design. I'm more of a person that codes.


## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

C++, Java, Python

2. Game development (any engine)

Gamemaker Studio 2

3. Unity

N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

N/A

2. Scope management

N/A

3. Iteration

Iteration is like looping through something till you meet a condition. Like when you iterate through an array you go through each thing in the list until you reach the end.

4. Object-Oriented programming

It's like where everything in the code is treated as an object,  like methods are also objects in the lanugage. You have classes which are the blueprints for objects and you create instances of the class which are objects.

5. Model-View-Controller architecture

N/A
